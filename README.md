# Grocery List App
This is a simple grocery list management app built with Flutter. The app allows users to create and manage a shopping list, with the ability to add, edit, delete items, and track quantities. The items are saved locally using SharedPreferences, and each item can be categorized with a color-coded category. Users can also check off items as they grab them.

## Features
➕ Add New Items: Add items to the grocery list with a name, quantity, and category.<br>
🖊️ Edit Items: Edit existing items in the list.<br>
➖ Delete Items: Remove items from the list.<br>
✅ Checkbox to Mark Items: Check off items to mark them as completed.<br>
📲 Categories: Items can be categorized and each category has its own color.<br>
🪪 Persistent Storage: Items are saved locally using SharedPreferences so they persist across app restarts.<br>

## Requirements
Flutter SDK (version 2.x or above)<br>
Dart SDK (compatible with Flutter)<br>
